# create_share_links
Uses the Chorus.fm share links format to create share links for songs or albums.

The music_to_share.md file takes songs and albums in this format:

# Songs
MxPx - Doing Time
The Ataris - Answers 

# Albums
Blink-182 - Enema of the State
Fall Out Boy - Take This To Your Grave 

-- 

Once the script is run, it'll append to the file the share links at the bottom.
