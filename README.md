# create_share_links
Uses the Chorus.fm share links format to create share links for songs or albums.

The music_to_share.md file takes songs and albums in this format:

.# Songs  
MxPx - Doing Time  
The Ataris - Answers 

.# Albums  
Blink-182 - Enema of the State  
Fall Out Boy - Take This To Your Grave  

-- 

Once the script is run, it'll append to the file the share links at the bottom. For example, the above would output these links at the bottom of the file: 

https://chorus.fm/share/song/mxpx/doing+time
https://chorus.fm/share/song/the+ataris/answers
https://chorus.fm/share/album/blink-182/enema+of+the+state
https://chorus.fm/share/album/fall+out+boy/take+this+to+your+grave
